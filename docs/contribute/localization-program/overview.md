# Localization Program

The Translation Program is a collaborative effort to translate all kinds of docs related to TON into different languages in order to make the website more accessible to billions of non-English speakers around the world.

## System design philosophy
![how it works](/img/localizationProgramGuideline/localization-program.png)

The localization program is **launched** and **actively maintained** by:            
[**TownSquare Labs**](https://github.com/TownSquareXYZ) one of the closest partners of **TON**. 

We commit ourselves to making an open infrastructure for multilingual community collaboration to **make TON get into a better phrase**, which includes:
  1. **Suitable for multilingual communities**   
   The program is designed to cater to a diverse global audience, supporting multiple languages to ensure inclusivity and ease of access for users from various linguistic backgrounds.

2. **Automate development, integration, and deployment**   
   By leveraging automation tools, the program streamlines the processes of development, integration, and deployment, reducing manual efforts and enhancing efficiency and consistency across all localization efforts.

3. **Decoupling the roles of developer, translator, and verifier**  
   Our approach separates the responsibilities of developers, translators, and verifiers, allowing each role to focus on their specific tasks. This ensures high-quality translations and smooth collaboration without overlap or conflict of duties.

4. **Community contribution incentive**  
   We provide incentives for community members who contribute to the localization process. This encourages active participation and rewards those who help improve the program, fostering a sense of ownership and community spirit.

5. **Integration of advanced AI systems**  
   Advanced AI systems enhance translation accuracy and efficiency by providing intelligent suggestions and automating repetitive tasks, ensuring high-quality results with less effort.
  
    **...**

It's not just some project for only one language user, our goal is **for the global developer ecosystem**.
